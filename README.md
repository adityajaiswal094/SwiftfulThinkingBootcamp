# SwiftfulThinking Bootcamp

## Learning SwiftUI - Basics to Advanced

### Lecture 1 -
- Using the `Text` component and its modifiers.

### Lecture 2 -
- Learning and using multiple `Shapes` provided by `SwiftUI` out of the box and their modifiers.
- All the modifiers that can be applied to any one of the shape can be applied to all the shapes.
- Shapes - `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Capsule`, `Rectangle` and `RoundedRectangle`.

### Lecture 3 -
- Learning about `frame`s.
- A combination of frames and background is very powerful:
    - In debugging
    - To shift a text to extreme left or right, instead of wrapping it in HStack, you can apply frame modifier (something I need to test in PayZapp SSO screen help icon).

### Lecture 4 -
- Learning about `background`s and `overlay`s.
- In this example we learn how we can stack multiple backgrounds and overlays on top of each other, getting creative and designing complex UI with SwiftUI.
- We can apply `background`s and `overlay`s to yet another `background` or `overlay` creating complex UI.
